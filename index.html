            This website serves as a demo of the
            <a href="https://github.com/wtrettien/manicule">Manicule web app</a> version 3 for
            exploring unique books and manuscripts. The <b>Browse</b> view allows you to read the
            fragments in order, following the modern pagination on the leaves and bifolia. Marginal
            notes beside each facsimile page indicate which lines from
            <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> are present; these notes can be changed by altering the
            <b>description</b> attribute in <b>pages.json</b>. Color-coded categories indicate which
            tale is present; these categories can also be changed in <b>pages.json</b> and the
            colors updated in <b>metadata.ts</b>. The <b>Structure</b> view shows where these
            fragments are conjoined, or not. This data is stored in <b>structure.xml</b>, which
            visualizes the format of a book using the
            <a href="https://github.com/leoba/VisColl">VisColl</a> data model.
