It was printed on a separate sheet and inserted into text before binding.</p>\\n\\t<p>Seventeenth-century readers would likely have been familiar with this image. It comes from the same block used to illustrate a frontispiece that drifts in and out of various issues of Robert Barker’s Bibles beginning as early as 1602. Sometimes it appears embedded within a strapwork frame, the top of which you can see on Benlowes’ woodcut. One amateur needleworker Anne Cornwallis even replicated it on her own Bible’s embroidered cover. The family of Benlowes’ printer Roger Norton had a decades-long dispute with the Barkers over certain patents and rights attending the office of the King’s Printer, and it seems likely that he had acquired this woodblock during his dramatic 1629 raid on the warehouse of the King’s Printer House, when he broke down a wall and removed a large quantity of books and stock. To my knowledge, it remained unused by Norton until Benlowes rediscovered it and convinced him to print new sheets to be tacked into his <em>Theophila</em>.</p>\\n</div>\\n\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
