The version that Benlowes had access to is half-length, lacking the background scenery and the somewhat bawdy epigraph of the full-length version, and he appears to have scratched off the caption.</p>\n\t<p>In nearly every extant copy of <em>Theophila</em> containing this found plate, it has been inserted at the beginning opposite a preliminary address to female readers. He instructs them to \u201cSurvey  THEOPHILA\u201d \u2014 that is, track the landscape of both the character, the poem, and the book \u2014 for it grows such \u201cfragrant Flow\u2019rs, \u2026 Blown by such Breath, drench\u2019t by such Dew,\u201d that when women read it, such plants might also \u201cSpring, & display their Buds,\u201d in them. In at least one copy \u2014 a presentation copy to his bookseller Humphrey Moseley \u2014 Benlowes has annotated the print with the caption: \u201cThis shewes a Lady should affect a Dresse, / That Modesty & Vertue may expresse.\u201d He has also added a series of anagrams in English, Latin and Greek on the name of \u201cSophia Lancaster,\u201d expressing her chaste virtue \u2014 for example, \u201cSophia Lancaster. / A plain chast Rose.\u201d By hinging female modesty to a fashionable woman \u2014 and the fragrant buds of spring to winter furs \u2014 Benlowes draws tension from the poem, turning a conventional address to the reader into a metaphysical puzzle. That he chooses to use a widely-copied engraving from a series that must have been known to many of his readers suggests his desire not only to add depth to his text but to rework the connotations of Hollar\u2019s image as it circulated outside the book. As with all of his found images, here the gatherings of his codex serve as a prism through which the reader\u2019s understanding passes, diffracting her prior associations and relations to popular visual and print cultures. </p>\n</div>\n"}}]);
