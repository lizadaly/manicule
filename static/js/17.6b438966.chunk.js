The kernel of the project is an eight-canto poem about the heroine\u2019s ascent to heaven. The first canto, \u201cThe Prelibation To the Sacrifice,\u201d ranges prefatorily over Benlowes\u2019 favorite themes \u2014 music, the militant Christian, the nature of eternity. The canto ends with this pattern poem in the shape of an altar,  thereby setting the stage \u2014 in a literal-minded way \u2014 for Theophila\u2019s sacrifice.</p>\n\t<p>Part of the deep history of concrete poetry, shaped verse was not uncommon in the early seventeenth century. George Herbert\u2019s <em>The Temple</em> (1633) famously contains two pattern poems, \u201cEaster Wings\u201d and \u201cThe Altar.\u201d Joshua Sylvester\u2019s 1604 translation of Guillaume du Bartas\u2019s <em>Divine Weeks and Works</em> turn dedicatory poems to the muses into altars. Both of these books influenced Benlowes; however, by the time his own <em>Theophila</em> appeared in 1652, the fad for pattern poetry had begun to fade. Of the two recycled plates with religious pattern poems that he tacks to the very end of the book, one is dated 1632, twenty years before Theophila was published. Thus the altar appears here much as the Adam and Eve or Queen Elizabeth woodcuts do later: as a throwback to an earlier moment. Later in the century, Samuel Butler would even lampoons Benlowes for his obsession with shaped verse, describing him a character sketch as a \u201cSmall Poet\u201d obsessed with \u201cEchoes, Rebus\u2019s, Chronograms, &c. besides Carwitchets, Clenches, and Quibbles. As for Altars and Pyramids in Poetry,\u201d he continues, \u201che has out-done all Men that Way.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]);
