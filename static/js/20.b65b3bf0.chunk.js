Scrubbed of her sin, Theophila here appears refulgent with \u201cHeav\u2019ns brighter Love,\u201d her body blazoned in language excerpted from amarous poetry and remade to describe God\u2019s purified creation. Her lips are \u201cRock-rubies, and her Veins wrought Saphyrs show.\u201d When Benlowes has exhausted that theme, Theophila\u2019s body is stretched to become a temple to house the devout poet\u2019s feast and a harp for his \u201cmosts harmonious Musicks,\u201d a phrase dissected in the etching, where King David playing his harp while Theophila holds the tables of Moses and sings heavenward. In the text, her own italicized speech and the narrator\u2019s voice begin to blend together typographically as her divine song mingles with his own, as you see if you page through this canto. By the end of the Canto and Theophila\u2019s \u201crestauration -- a fantasy of the restored monarch -- the poem begins to enter a more mystical register.</p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]);
