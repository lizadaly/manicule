Benlowes himself understood it differently. In a prefatory poem written \u201cTo My <em>Fancie</em> Upon <em>Theophila</em>,\u201d Benlowes formulates his writing process as a function of his \u201cfancy,\u201d a word meaning something like \u201cimagination\u201d: the mind\u2019s innate capacity to conjure objects that do not have an physical existence or events that never actually happened. It links etymologically to the noun \u201cfantasy,\u201d a fantastical or pleasure-giving mental image, and through this relationship begins to take on an erotic overtone in the seventeenth century, sometimes meaning something more like \u201cdesire\u201d or \u201clonging\u201d \u2014 a sense still retained in today\u2019s British usage of \u201cfancy\u201d as a verb for a physical attraction. Instructing his fancy to \u201cFly\u2026 Beauties arched Brow\u201d and \u201cEvade ... peach-bloom Cheek-Decoies,\u201dBenlowes focuses his verse on the higher order of \u201cseraphic love.\u201d There is a double meaning in these lines: he is both shooing his own desires away from physical beauty and instructing his poem to abandon empty metaphors, since language alone cannot tap into the divine. </p>\n</div>\n"}}]);
