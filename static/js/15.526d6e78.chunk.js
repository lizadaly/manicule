Opposite her is an idealized, youthful Benlowes (who in fact would have been 49 at the time). His foot rests on the world, a signal of his indifference to earthly matters, and his back is to the reader \u2014 a pose that he often struck in portraits, preferring to style himself as a humble servant to poesy rather than its master. For instance, in an oil painting that he gave to St. John\u2019s College, his alma mater, his face turns away from the viewer while his finger points emphatically at an open Bible, redirecting the reader\u2019s attention away from him and toward the book. The verse accompanying the engraving calls this curly-haired figure the \u201cAuthor,\u201d and he holds a quill as if writing; yet he gazes at his female subject in a way that suggests he is actually sketching her portrait, attempting to \u201csurvay, / How He may THEOPHIL portray.\u201d Elsewhere in the preface Benlowes styles himself a \u201cComposer,\u201d as does Thomas Phillipot in his commendatory verse \u201cTo the Renowned COMPOSER,\u201d characterizing his creative labors as akin to arranging music or setting type for a printed book. In these synaesthetic shifts, Benlowes frames his own authorship as a process of mediating the divine \u2014 of adorning and dressing it in ornate visual and verbal trappings suitable to such a transcendent subject.</p>\n\t<p>If the bottom of half of the engraving shows Benlowes\u2019 process of composition, the top half figures its product: the book <em>Theophila</em>, flying above the two figures and clutched in the talons of an eagle. The eagle is the symbol of John the Evangelist, often portrayed as a curly-haired youth in the medieval and early modern periods, and the pairing of an effeminate young man writing near such a bird would likely have spurred in readers\u2019 minds a parallel between the author and this most mystical of the evangelists. An eagle carrying something in its talons may also have suggested to readers the myth of Ganymede, the beautiful Greek shepherd boy kidnapped by Zeus. Smitten with the boy, Zeus disguised himself as an eagle to steal Ganymede away to Olympus, where he raped him and forced him into servitude. The story was \u201cthe best known myth of homoerotic desire in early modern England,\u201d as Bruce Smith has pointed out, especially desire between masters and their male servants. It was copied in emblem books from Alciati\u2019s <em>Emblemata</em> to Henry Peacham\u2019s <em>Minerva Brittania</em>. The shared eagle imagery further linked John the Evangelist to male sexuality. This coupling finds its most notorious expression in the posthumous charges against Christopher Marlowe, said to have claimed Christ and John were \u201cbedfellows\u201d and lovers; but it has deeper roots stretching back to the thirteenth-century Christian treatise on Ovid, <em>Ovide moralise</em>, where Ganymede is said to prefigure John. By the time Benlowes was writing, this emblematic triangulation of eagles, evangelists, and sodomy had begun to fuel the intense homoerotics of divine metaphysical verse, as Richard Rambuss has shown, with poets like Thomas Traherne describing themselves as Christ\u2019s Ganymede, snatched away from earth and carried to heaven for spiritual consummation. Benlowes plays on these themes in this authorial portrait but substitutes the beautiful boy Ganymede for his beautiful book <em>Theophila</em>, an erotically-charged object that was in fact lovingly hand-assembled by Benlowes at home with his servant Schoren and engravers like Barlow. In this plate\u2019s imagery, his creation is so exquisite that, through the power of Christ\u2019s desire, it can transcend the messy scene of its own writing and ascend rapturously on the wings of an eagle. Thus Benlowes\u2019 queer affinity for material form and ornament, much derided by his later critics, is here the very reason his work is able to touch heaven.</p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]);
