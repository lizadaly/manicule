Its narrative has evaporated, leaving a constellation of superlatives, and Theophila abandons the poet, “as vanisht Lightning.” Having set himself the task of singing the song of Theophila’s sacrifice, in the end the narrator, still trapped in his physical body, is only able to “re-act her Part” as “Fleet Joy runs Races through [his] Blood through thousand Veins.”</p>\\n</div>\\n\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
