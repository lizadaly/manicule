Rather than inserting the images as plates, the printer has often set them in the letterpress, as with this image of Elizabeth at prayer. Over 70 years old, it comes from Richard and John Day\u2019s <em>A Booke of Christian Prayers</em>, well known today for its elaborate and large narrative borders printed on every page, where it serves as a kind of frontispiece in the editions of 1578 and 1581. Here, Benlowes has repurposed it in a brief discussion of Elizabeth as a proto-Theophila and a prefigure for King Charles the Martyr. As with the woodblock of Adam and Eve, the printer Roger Norton may have acquired this block during his raid on the offices of the King\u2019s Printer in 1629. Perhaps it caught Benlowes\u2019 eye in Norton\u2019s shop, and he asked him to use it to illustrate this brief mention of the Queen in the poem. </p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]);
