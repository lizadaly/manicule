Here, Benlowes has rendered miscellaneity as desirable and, more precisely, his patchwork method of composition as a process of desiring: it feeds the composer\u2019s bottomless craving for an ineffable, intangible God whose enormity can only be glimpsed in this realm through endless material recombinance. \nContinuing, Benlowes mingles images of mixed writing with eating miscellaneous food:</p>\n\n<p>Mix Balm with Ink; Let thy Salt heal: <br>\nTeach Palate various Manna deal.<br>\nHave for the Wise strong Sense, deep Truth:<br>\nGrand-Sallat of choice Wit for Youth.</p>\n\n<p>A pun on \u201cpalate\u201d treats the mouth as the \u201cpalette\u201d for mixing the divine inks of the text, turning printed words to food. The wordplay extends to the typography of the next line, where a long-s on \u201cWise\u201d \u2014 possibly a compositor\u2019s confusion or intentional ambiguity \u2014 turns \u201cstrong Sense\u201d and \u201cdeep Truth\u201d into the poet\u2019s wife and wisdom. Pulling together this imagery, the final line grows from this mixed seed a \u201cGrand-Sallet of choice Wit,\u201d a \u201cGrand-Sallet\u201d being an early modern salad of greens, fruits, and nuts and more general metaphor for miscellaneity, as discussed in John Evelyn\u2019s <em>Acetaria, a discourse of sallets</em> (1699). Thus the very mixed metaphors mocked by Benlowes\u2019 critics are here placed at the core of his method, demanding of the reader a different relationship to the poem and its material assemblage. By gathering together ever more found plates and printed texts and recycled poems and translations and manuscript additions and music, <em>Theophila</em> is not failing to cohere so much as it is fueling Benlowes\u2019 fancy. In so doing, it memorializes for its readers God\u2019s infinite variety and divine love. </p>\n</div>\n"}}]);
