However, at some point after these segments were already in press, Benlowes decided to add more content — more untitled Latin poems, some short Latin prose, two new cantos on retiring to the countryside, and a Latin translation of Canto 7 by Jeremy Collier. This final chunk of content — 16 sheets or 64 pages total — is printed on paper stock that is consistently different from the rest of the book, indicating it was completed at a separate time, and it is gathered in simple bifolia rather than quires of three, as you can see in the book structure diagram above. Perhaps the printer Roger Norton, weary of Benlowes’ constant additions to the project, decided to choose a format more amenable to such accretions.</p>\\n\\t<p>As with the earlier part of the book, Benlowes continues to reuse found plates and woodblocks. This plate in particular offers a unique glimpse into his bespoke collaborations with printers and engravers. It appears to be a frontispiece or engraved title page to a octavo edition of <em>Theophila</em>. Such an edition was never appeared, and this prematurely commissioned engraving by Pierre Lombart remains as a ghost plate, evidence of a book that never was. It shows Theophila as <em>anima</em>, “divine love,” looking up to the trinity of heaven; beside her is a loose sheet inscribed with the “THEOPHILA’S LOVE SACRIFICE. WRITTEN BY EDW BENLOWES ESQU.” — a early title variant that Benlowes uses in the first cantos of the poem. When this plate appears in extant copies of <em>Theophila</em>, its positioning varies. Of those books still in Benlowes’ original binding, it tends to appear before a recapitulation of Theophila’s journey to heaven or sometimes in the middle of Canto 2, when she is beginning her journey — both positions that make sense, given the general and summative nature of the image. In copies that were rebound by Francis Bedford in the nineteenth century, as this one was, it is often called into service as a frontispiece to Canto 13, “The Pleasure of Retirement,”, and somewhat incomprehensibly so; Theophila has exited the poem and ascended to heaven by this point. It would seem that nineteenth-century collectors, baffled by the book’s proliferation of misfit plates, favored the structurally coherent system of only inserting images as divisions between cantos rather than Benlowes’ more organic, fanciful approach to book illustration.</p>\\n</div>\\n\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
