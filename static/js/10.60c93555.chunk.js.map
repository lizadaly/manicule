Benlowes himself understood it differently. In a prefatory poem written “To My <em>Fancie</em> Upon <em>Theophila</em>,” Benlowes formulates his writing process as a function of his “fancy,” a word meaning something like “imagination”: the mind’s innate capacity to conjure objects that do not have an physical existence or events that never actually happened. It links etymologically to the noun “fantasy,” a fantastical or pleasure-giving mental image, and through this relationship begins to take on an erotic overtone in the seventeenth century, sometimes meaning something more like “desire” or “longing” — a sense still retained in today’s British usage of “fancy” as a verb for a physical attraction. Instructing his fancy to “Fly… Beauties arched Brow” and “Evade ... peach-bloom Cheek-Decoies,”Benlowes focuses his verse on the higher order of “seraphic love.” There is a double meaning in these lines: he is both shooing his own desires away from physical beauty and instructing his poem to abandon empty metaphors, since language alone cannot tap into the divine. </p>\\n</div>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
