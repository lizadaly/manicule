The kernel of the project is an eight-canto poem about the heroine’s ascent to heaven. The first canto, “The Prelibation To the Sacrifice,” ranges prefatorily over Benlowes’ favorite themes — music, the militant Christian, the nature of eternity. The canto ends with this pattern poem in the shape of an altar,  thereby setting the stage — in a literal-minded way — for Theophila’s sacrifice.</p>\\n\\t<p>Part of the deep history of concrete poetry, shaped verse was not uncommon in the early seventeenth century. George Herbert’s <em>The Temple</em> (1633) famously contains two pattern poems, “Easter Wings” and “The Altar.” Joshua Sylvester’s 1604 translation of Guillaume du Bartas’s <em>Divine Weeks and Works</em> turn dedicatory poems to the muses into altars. Both of these books influenced Benlowes; however, by the time his own <em>Theophila</em> appeared in 1652, the fad for pattern poetry had begun to fade. Of the two recycled plates with religious pattern poems that he tacks to the very end of the book, one is dated 1632, twenty years before Theophila was published. Thus the altar appears here much as the Adam and Eve or Queen Elizabeth woodcuts do later: as a throwback to an earlier moment. Later in the century, Samuel Butler would even lampoons Benlowes for his obsession with shaped verse, describing him a character sketch as a “Small Poet” obsessed with “Echoes, Rebus’s, Chronograms, &c. besides Carwitchets, Clenches, and Quibbles. As for Altars and Pyramids in Poetry,” he continues, “he has out-done all Men that Way.”</p>\\n</div>\\n\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
