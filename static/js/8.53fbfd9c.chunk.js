At some point, Benlowes decided to write a ninth canto in Latin, \u201cRecapitulatio,\u201d then translated this into English as \u201cThe Recapitulation\u201d; it is tacked after Canto 8 in facing-page translation. Even having summarized the poem, he is unwilling to consider <em>Theophila</em> finished. Latin translations of Canto 1 and 3 done by Benlowes\u2019 friend Alexander Ross follow, then there is a previously-unpublished poem by Own Feltham, \u201cUpon the Vanitie of the World\u201d and some more Latin verse. Feltham\u2019s poem launches Benlowes into his own poem, \u201cThe Vanitie of the World.\u201d This is a new work, with a new title \u2014 Benlowes has shifted away from <em>Theophila</em> and is now addressing his \u201cHeadlesse, heady Age\u201d \u2014 but nevertheless he numbers the cantos 10 and 11, as if they were continuing the earlier work. Again, the poem ends, this time punctuated with this engraving of a young woman dressed lightly, her hair curled about her ears. She is Hollar\u2019s \u201cSpring Woman,\u201d from the same series as the woman dressed in furs at the beginning of the book, here set on the page with the letterpress. As with the \u201cWinter Woman,\u201d Benlowes uses Hollar\u2019s bright image as an ironic foil to the poem\u2019s final castigation of unchaste women. On several extant copies, Benlowes has even painted the women\u2019s lips pink and tattooed her skin with asterisks, upside crescent moons, dots, and other obscure astrological or typographic marks to her forehead and cheeks in ink, as if to annotate her body with the transcendent geometries \u2014 figured in Barlow\u2019s etchings for Cantos 7 and 8 \u2014 that she should be contemplating.</p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]);
