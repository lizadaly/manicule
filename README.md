```
npm run dev
```

This app was built and designed by Liza Daly and Whitney Trettien, with support from the Price Lab for Digital Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania. We have also benefited from the input, generosity, and open data of the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts and the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies.

Our manicule icon comes from page 365 of the records of Christian Lehman, a notary who lived in Germantown and Philadelphia in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is MS Codex 1713 at the University of Pennsylvania.
