<div>
    <h1>This is another tour stop.</h1>
    <p>
        To add more tour stops, create an HTML file like this one, with a basic div container. Name
        it using the index number of the page you'd like to attach the tour stop to. (The index of
        the left page showing on any spread is the number at the end of the URL above; add one for
        the right page.) Upload the file to the directory:
        <code>data/{name of your book}/tour/</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be sure to update the <code>tour.json</code> file in the same folder, which orders the tour.
        A tour can zigzag non-linearly across a book, but you must update the JSON file.
